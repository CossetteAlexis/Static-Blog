                                        <p>
                                            Angkas is an easy way of transportation since it can easily
                                            pass through the narrow roads and everywhere you go there are always a motorcycles who waits for passengers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Angkas is the source of income to many people. If Angkas will be illegalized many will lose there job and many family
                                            will starve because Angkas is the only source of their income.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are so many people who don't have jobs then it will increase if they will illegalized Angkas. How can they
                                            solve
                                            it if they can't give jobs to the unemployed Filipinos?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Student like me always ride habal-habal every school days and I can really say that if it will be illegalize many
                                            will
                                            suffer not just only the drivers and their family but also to those people who is dependent to the motorcycles.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Every people who rides in habal-habal or in Angkas knows very well the risks on riding motorcycles but it is the
                                            most
                                            convenient form of transportation to get to work, school, and to the other destination. It is right to legalize
                                            Angkas
                                            as a form of transportation and make it a public vehicle. There is no such place where accidents don't happen. Just
                                            wear
                                            your helmet wherever you ride Angkas for your safety.

                                        We cannot deny it. Angkas is one of the most trusted transportation services. From customer service to ride experience,
                                        they have rightfully earned a place in Filipinos’ hearts.  Every Angkas driver we meet is friendly and always makes sure that we
                                        stay safe on the road, and not to mention, they follow traffic rules.

                                        students and professionals from being late. Aside from that, they are cheaper than those habal-habal drivers who usually
                                        overcharge fare rates. Angkas also offers fare promos from time to time which can be as low as 50 php off on every ride.

                                        These professional bikers would, at times, ask you if you are running late or what time is your class or shift. Then,
